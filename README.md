## Week 2
Week 2 touches upon Introduction to `pandas` library. The topics covered are:
* The series data structure
* Querying a series
* `dataFrame` data structure
* DataFrame Indexing and Loading

## Week 3
Week 3 dives deeper in python `pandas` library. It covers
* merging DataFrames
* generating summary tables
* grouping data into logical pieces
* manipulating dates
* scaling data
* and, dealing with issues in creating metrics for analysis

### Resources

* Assignment 3 loads energy Indicator data sets and merges them to calculate important metrics. [Assignment 3 notebook](https://github.com/sumitkant/Coursera-UoM_Intro_to_Data_Science_in_Python/blob/master/Week%203/Assignment_3.ipynb)

## Week 4
This week deals with understanding distributions and Hypotheses generation. 

### Resources
* [Week 4 Notebook](https://github.com/sumitkant/Coursera-UoM_Intro_to_Data_Science_in_Python/blob/master/Week%204/Week_4.ipynb)
* Assignment 4 takes university town dataset and test the hypotheses _University towns have their mean housing prices less effected by recessions_. This is tested by conducting a `t-test` to compare the ratio of the mean price of houses in university towns the quarter before the recession starts compared to the recession bottom.
